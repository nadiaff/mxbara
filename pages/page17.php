	<p class="comix-text">This restaurant is stocked to the gills with friable frozen treats and the paper products used to serve them. Shipments are brought in by truck every Friday and checked thoroughly by the conscientious PICKLE INSPECTOR. If you continue to work hard and show the higher-ups your true mettle, you too might one day reach that vaunted position on your ECHELADDER. Except only someone with the mental capacity of an especially stupid monkey would choose that NICHEPATH.</p>

	<p class="comix-text">Okay, that was a little unfair. The guy who does the job now is really nice. He strikes you as the sort of person given to fanciful inspirations, not unlike the ones you regularly jot down in one of your many WRITING JOURNALS (not to be confused with the secret one.) In the few instances where you managed to hold a conversation with him, he seemed intelligent and  erudite. In fact, it’s a bit of a mystery to you why he’s doing this job rather than going for something more ambitious and profitable. You suspect that extreme social awkwardness and anxiety have landed him in the pickle he’s in now.</p>
