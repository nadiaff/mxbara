	<p class="comix-text">Welcome to SQUIDDLE BURGER home of the squiddle burger, the only burger made with 100% real squiddle! Haha, just kidding. Probably. Maybe. No one actually knows what goes into making the pale, mulched up fishmeat patties that this chain is famous for. You used to love eating them when you were a kid, but since coming to work here, you’ve become leery, not only of their nutritional content, but of the potentially MIND ALTERING PROPERTIES they possess.</p>
	<p class="comix-text">Behind you are the WORK STATIONS where you pour drinks, heat up ingredients and arrange them into something vaguely resembling a meal. Above your head hang menus and cheerful advertisements endorsing the latest additions to the franchise’s lineup. You once read that they used paint and glue to make the food look more vibrant in those pictures. You’re not sure if they still do or if they just shop it all up with ~the Adobe suite~. GRAPHIC DESIGN is something you only dabbled in a little before realizing that your ARTISTIC TALENTS were not appreciated by the soulless advertising establishment. </p>
	<p class="comix-text">There are a number of CUSTOMERS waiting to be served and ORDERS that need filling. </p>
	<p class="comix-text">What will you do?</p>
