	<p class="comix-text">Your name is ROSE EGBERT-LALONDE. As was previously mentioned, today is your BIRTHDAY. This might be cause for celebration if attendance at your SHITTY JOB wasn’t mandatory. Also, if you had anyone nearby to engage in festive hijinx with, such as friends, lovers, siblings, acquaintances or really anyone other than the PARENTS whose roof you continue to dwell under. You wish you were under that roof right now, even if it makes you feel like you’re living an EXTENDED CHILDHOOD. Almost anything is better than the drudgery of serving up endless rounds of mashed cephalopod patties to the ravenous masses.</p>
	<p class="comix-text">Familiarity with the inner workings of SQUIDDLE BURGER would be enough to darken anyone’s youthful memories of the eponymous cartoon <a href="comix.php?p=12">cetaceans</a>, and yet somehow you have managed to maintain a profound interest in TENTACLED ORGANISMS. Whether they be cute and cuddly objects of fantasy, biologically diverse nautical reality or dubiously corporeal monstrosities, you love them all. You even possess an absurd fondness for the requisite HUMILIATING HEADGEAR your place of employment forces you to wear. Not that you’d ever admit it aloud or even write about it in the SECRET JOURNAL you keep hidden under your mattress. You learned years ago not to write anything too personal in it.</p>
